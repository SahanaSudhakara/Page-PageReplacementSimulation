Swapped out process is C with evicted page Number 37
Swapped out process is BM with evicted page Number 77

The output represents a log of process details and the corresponding memory map at different time stamps. Additionally, it mentions the swapped out processes and their evicted page numbers.

Time Stamp: The timestamp of the log entry.
Process: The name of the process.
Enter/exit: Indicates whether the process enters or exits.
Arrival Time: The time at which the process arrives.
Size in Pages: The size of the process in pages.
Here's a breakdown of the provided output:

At time stamp 1016602705:
Process C enters with a size of 4 pages.
Memory Map: Empty (no pages allocated yet).
At time stamp 1016602717:
Process BM enters with a size of 2 pages.
Memory Map: Pages allocated for Process C at page 37, 36, 32, and 24.
Additionally, the output mentions the swapped out processes and their evicted page numbers. It indicates that process C was swapped out, and its page number 37 was evicted. Similarly, process BM was also swapped out, and its page number 77 was evicted.
